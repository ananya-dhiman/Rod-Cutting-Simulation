#  Rod Cutting Simulation (Tkinter GUI)

This project is a Python application that simulates the **Rod Cutting Problem** using **Dynamic Programming**, visualizing the optimal way to cut a rod to maximize profit.

---

##  Problem Statement

Given a rod of length `n` and an array of prices that contains prices of all pieces smaller than `n`, determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

---

##  Features

- **Input**: User can enter space-separated prices for lengths 1 to `n`.
- **Rod Length**: User inputs total rod length to cut.

### Output:
- Maximum profit that can be obtained.
- List of cut sizes to achieve that profit.

### Visual Representation:
- Colorful blocks representing different cut lengths on a canvas.

##  Logic and Approach

The program uses **Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)** to solve the rod cutting problem:

1. Create a DP table `dp[]` where `dp[i]` stores the maximum profit for a rod of length `i`.
2. For every length `i`, iterate over all possible first cuts `j` (from 1 to `i`).
3. Update the maximum profit using:

## The app will display:
